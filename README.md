                               TASK 4

          Build a Version-Controlled DevOps Project with Git

This repository demonstrates a standard Git workflow using branches (`main`, `dev`, `feature`), Git best practices, and proper version control management.

ðŸ“‚ Branch Strategy

- `main` - Stable production branch.
- `dev` - Development/testing branch.
- `feature` - For creating and testing new features before 
              merging into `dev`.


Step 1: Initialize Local Repository and Connect to GitHub
```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/SuryaSJV/Gir-workflow.git
git branch -M main
```

Step 2: Create First File and Push to "main"
```
echo "This is my first file." > file1.txt
git add .
git commit -m "created file1.txt"
git push -u origin main
```

Step 3: Create "dev" Branch and Add Another File
```
git checkout -b dev
echo "this is my second file." > file2.txt
git add .
git commit -m "created file2.txt"
git push -u origin dev
```

Step 4: Merge "dev" into "main"
```
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge dev
git push origin main
```

Step 5: Create feature Branch from dev and Add File
```
git checkout dev
git checkout -b feature
echo "this is my third file." > file3.txt
git add .
git commit -m "created file3.txt"
git push -u origin feature
```

Step 6: Merge "feature" â†’ "dev", Then "dev" â†’ "main"

   Merge feature into dev
```
git checkout dev
git merge feature
git push origin dev
```

   Merge dev into main
```
git checkout main
git merge dev
git push origin main
```


7. Achieved .gitignore and tagging 
```
git tag -a v1.0 -m "Initial release with features, .gitignore, and documentation"

git push origin v1.0
```

âœ… Final Files in Repository
```
file1.txt â†’ from main
file2.txt â†’ added in dev
file3.txt â†’ added in feature
.gitigone â†’ added files those are not usually in github repository
README.md â†’  explaining the whole project and work flow
```
